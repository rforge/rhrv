In the previous sections, we have used the 
\textit{HRVData}  structure  to store all \gls{HRV} information related to the 
signal being analyzed with no knowledge about its internal structure. However, 
sometimes, in order to make some particular analysis of the data, it may be 
interesting to access them directly. Figure \ref{fig:dataScheme} summarizes the 
most important fields in the
\textit{HRVData} structure. Since all the data in this structure is stored as 
an R list, each of its fields can be accessed using the \$ operator of the R 
language. For example, if we want to access the RR time series of the 
\textit{hrv.data}, we would use:
\begin{Schunk}
\begin{Sinput}
> RR = hrv.data$Beat$RR

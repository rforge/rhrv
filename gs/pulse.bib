@article{Trzebski2001Non-linear-dyna,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Testing the hypothesis that alterations in non-linear dynamics of the cardiovascular variability appear in healthy, awake subjects during voluntary apnea.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ten young subjects performed 20 apneas 60 s each separated by 1 min free breathing. Inter-beat interval (IBI) measured as RR-interval in ECG, systolic (SYS) and diastolic (DIAS) arterial blood pressure. stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were non-invasively recorded and computed by Portapress 2 system. Correlation dimension according to Grassberger-Proccacia algorithm (CD) and ratio of % determinism versus % recurrence (RDR) computed 
from recurrence plot according to Webber and Zbiluth [J. Appl. Physiol. 76 (1994) 965] were used as the indices of chaos and complexity. Sequential time series of cardiovascular variables in consecutive 60-s apneas and inter-apnea free breathings were separately windowed and aggregated. CD and RDR of aggregated apneic time series were compared with CD and RDR values of aggregated time series of inter-apnea free breathing, 10 min at rest and 10 min recovery. Reliability of the aggregation method of sequential time series was tested on transformed simulated data generated by Lorenz model. Error in CD and RDR estimation did not exceed 5% and 1%. respectively.
RESULTS: CD of cardiovascular variables computed from aggregated apneas was significantly reduced and RDR augmented versus control and recovery periods. CD and RDR values of inter-apnea phases were in between those in control and during apneas. Time domain linear variance (SD) was increased during aggregated apneas.
CONCLUSIONS: Signal dynamics dependent windowing and data aggregation could be a useful tool for non-linear analysis of short repeatable sequential time series; time domain linear variability of the cardiovascular dynamics is augmented while complexity reduced during apneic chemoreceptor stimulation; alterations in non-linear dynamics of cardiovascular variables during apneas in healthy normotensive subjects may suggest an early sign of a mechanism implicated in arterial hypertension in OSAS.},

@article{Marwan2002Recurrence-plot,
	Abstract = {The knowledge of transitions between regular, laminar or chaotic behaviors is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms behind complex systems. While several linear approaches are often insufficient to describe such processes, there are several nonlinear methods that, however, require rather long time observations. To overcome these difficulties, we propose measures of complexity based on vertical structures in recurrence plots and apply them to the logistic map as well as to heart-rate-variability data. For the logistic map these measures enable us not only to detect transitions between chaotic and periodic states, but also to identify laminar states, i.e., chaos-chaos transitions. The traditional recurrence quantification analysis fails to detect the latter transitions. Applying our measures to the heart-rate-variability data, we are able to detect and quantify the laminar phases before a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia occurs thereby facilitating a prediction of such an event. Our findings could be of importance for the therapy of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.},

	Abstract = {Frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is used for the evaluation of autonomic activity. Non-linear domain parameters from HRV are also considered useful. However, properties of the latter have not yet been clearly characterized. Therefore, we studied the relationships among the frequency domain and non-linear parameters from HRV. Continuous Holter electrocardiographic monitoring was conducted on 43 healthy female medical staff including laboratory technologists and nurses during an 8-hour working period in our hospital. Low and high frequency components (LF and HF, respectively) of the frequency domain, recurrence rate (REC%) on recurrence plot analysis, scaling exponents al and a2 on detrended fluctuation analysis, and approximate entropy (ApEn) were obtained from HRV. Both the LF/HF ratio and HF were correlated with al and ApEn. REC% was correlated with ApEn and alpha2, whereas alpha2 was correlated only with REC%. Although autonomic parameters from the frequency domain are closely related with some of the non-linear parameters, it is suggested that a2 and REC% reflect different physiological activities.},

@article{Mohebbi2011Structures-of-t,
	Abstract = {This paper aims to propose an effective paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) predictor which is based on the analysis of the heart rate variability (HRV) signal. Predicting the onset of PAF, based on non-invasive techniques, is clinically important and can be invaluable in order to avoid useless therapeutic interventions and to minimize the risks for the patients. This method consists of four steps: Preprocessing, feature extraction, feature reduction, and classification. In the first step, the QRS complexes are detected from the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and then the HRV signal is extracted. In the next step, the recurrence plot (RP) of HRV signal is obtained and six features are extracted to characterize the basic patterns of the RP. These features consist of length of longest diagonal segments, average length of the diagonal lines, entropy, trapping time, length of longest vertical line, and recurrence trend. In the third step, these features are reduced to three features by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) technique. Using LDA not only reduces the number of the input features, but also increases the classification accuracy by selecting the most discriminating features. Finally, a support vector machine-based classifier is used to classify the HRV signals. The performance of the proposed method in prediction of PAF episodes was evaluated using the Atrial Fibrillation Prediction Database which consists of both 30-minutes ECG recordings end just prior to the onset of PAF and segments at least 45 min distant from any PAF events. The obtained sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictivity were 96.55%, 100%, and 100%, respectively.},

@article{Muralikrishnan2013Poincare-plot-o,
	Abstract = {Obesity has been shown to affect cardiovascular function. Heart rate variability (HRV) has been an accepted method of measuring cardiovascular autonomic function. The aim of the study is to evaluate the impact of obesity on HRV using Poincar{\'e} plot (POP) analysis. A finding of sympathovagal imbalance in pre-obese adults in respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA) could provide important diagnostic information about early subclinical autonomic dysfunction in obesity. Thirty one obese (BMI 26.84 +/- 2.47) adult males (25.42 +/- 7.86 years) were compared with 31 normal subjects (25.38 +/- 4.61 years). In all participants, anthropometric and blood pressure (BP) measurements were performed. After rest at supine position for 5 minutes, they were asked to do control deep breathing for 1 minute. HRV was measured in terms of POP analysis. Differences in Resting heart rate (RHR) (P < or = 0.025), Pulse pressure (PP) (P < or = 0.048), SD1 (P < or = 0.042) and SD2 (P < or = 0.039) of the POP between the two groups were significant. Correlation between Body mass index (BMI) and (PP) (p = 0.19); SD1 (p = 0.47) and SD2 (p = 0.39) of the POP were significant in obese groups. Obesity is related to sympathovagal imbalance characterized by depressed parasympathetic tone and increased sympathetic activity. Nonlinear methods like POP permit simple assessment of autonomic function, despite measuring different aspects of HRV.},

@article{Howorka2013Effects-of-guid,
	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Our aim was to investigate medium-term
	effects of device-guided breathing on blood pressure (BP) and its
	capacity to improve the cardiovascular autonomic balance in
	hypertensive diabetic patients. This feasibility study was conceived
	as a proof-of-concept trial under real life conditions for
	justification of further investigations. METHODS: A randomized,
	controlled study (RCT) of the effects of device-guided slow
	breathing on top of usual care against usual care alone (including
	non-pharmacological and pharmacological treatment). The intervention
	included 12-min sessions of guided breathing performed daily for
	8weeks. Treatment effects were assessed with ambulatory blood
	pressure monitoring (24h ABPM) and with spectral analysis of
	short-term heart rate variability (HRV) obtained during standardized
	modified orthostatic load. Thirty-two subjects with diabetes and
	antihypertensive therapy were randomly assigned to both study
	groups. RESULTS: After 8weeks of guided breathing, significant
	reductions were demonstrated in 24h systolic BP (x$\pm$SEM:
	126.1$\pm$3.0 vs 123.2$\pm$2.7mmHg, p=0.01), and in 24h pulse
	pressure (PP, 53.6$\pm$2.6 vs. 51.3$\pm$2.5mmHg, p=0.01), whereas no
	significant impact in the control group was shown. The differences
	in treatment effects (delta mmHg, RESPeRATE{\textregistered} vs
	control) were significant only for PP (-2.3$\pm$0.8 vs
	+0.2$\pm$1.2mmHg, p<0.05). Strong baseline dependence of treatment
	effects (delta systolic BP) was observed (p<0.01). Guided breathing
	showed a stronger treatment effect in terms of an increase in HRV,
	predominantly in low frequency band (p<0.03 vs. usual care).
	CONCLUSION: Even in well controlled hypertensive diabetic patients,
	guided breathing induced relevant effects on BP and HRV, finding
	which should be investigated further.},

@article{Kamath2013Analysis-of-hea,
	Abstract = {Abstract This study investigated the level of chaos and
	the existence of fractal patterns in the heart rate variability
	(HRV) signal prior to meditation and during meditation using two
	quantifiers adapted from non-linear dynamics and deterministic chaos
	theory: (1) component central tendency measures (CCTMs) and (2)
	Higuchi fractal dimension (HFD). CCTM quantifies degree of
	variability/chaos in the specified quadrant of the second-order
	difference plot for HRV time series, while HFD quantifies
	dimensional complexity of the HRV series. Both the quantifiers
	yielded excellent results in discriminating the different
	psychophysiological states. The study found (1) significantly higher
	first quadrant CCTM values and (2) significantly lower HFD values
	during meditation state compared to pre-meditation state. Both of
	these can be attributed to the respiratory-modulated oscillations
	shifting to the lower frequency region by parasympathetic tone
	during meditation. It is thought that these quantifiers are most
	promising in providing new insight into the evolution of complexity
	of underlying dynamics in different physiological states.},

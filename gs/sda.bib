	Abstract = {Affective instability is a core feature of borderline personality disorder (BPD). The use of advanced assessment methodologies and appropriate statistical analyses has led to consistent findings that indicate a heightened instability in patients with BPD compared with healthy controls. However, few studies have investigated the specificity of affective instability among patients with BPD with regard to relevant clinical control groups. In this study, 43 patients with BPD, 28 patients with posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD), 20 patients with bulimia nervosa (BN), and 28 healthy controls carried e-diaries for 24 hours and were prompted to rate their momentary affective states approximately every 15 minutes while awake. To quantify instability, we used 3 state-of-the-art indices: multilevel models for squared successive differences (SSDs), multilevel models for probability of acute changes (PACs), and aggregated point-by-point changes (APPCs). Patients with BPD displayed heightened affective instability for emotional valence and distress compared with healthy controls, regardless of the specific instability indices. These results directly replicate earlier studies. However, affective instability did not seem to be specific to patients with BPD. With regard to SSDs, PACs, and APPCs, patients with PTSD or BN showed a similar heightened instability of affect (emotional valence and distress) to that of patients with BPD. Our results give raise to the discussion if affective instability is a transdiagnostic or a disorder-specific mechanism. Current evidence cannot answer this question, but investigating psychopathological mechanisms in everyday life across disorders is a promising approach to enhance validity and specificity of mental health diagnoses.

	Abstract = {The knowledge of transitions between regular, laminar or chaotic behaviors is essential to understand the underlying mechanisms behind complex systems. While several linear approaches are often insufficient to describe such processes, there are several nonlinear methods that, however, require rather long time observations. To overcome these difficulties, we propose measures of complexity based on vertical structures in recurrence plots and apply them to the logistic map as well as to heart-rate-variability data. For the logistic map these measures enable us not only to detect transitions between chaotic and periodic states, but also to identify laminar states, i.e., chaos-chaos transitions. The traditional recurrence quantification analysis fails to detect the latter transitions. Applying our measures to the heart-rate-variability data, we are able to detect and quantify the laminar phases before a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia occurs thereby facilitating a prediction of such an event. Our findings could be of importance for the therapy of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.},

@article{Mohebbi2011Structures-of-t,
	Abstract = {This paper aims to propose an effective paroxysmal atrial fibrillation (PAF) predictor which is based on the analysis of the heart rate variability (HRV) signal. Predicting the onset of PAF, based on non-invasive techniques, is clinically important and can be invaluable in order to avoid useless therapeutic interventions and to minimize the risks for the patients. This method consists of four steps: Preprocessing, feature extraction, feature reduction, and classification. In the first step, the QRS complexes are detected from the electrocardiogram (ECG) signal and then the HRV signal is extracted. In the next step, the recurrence plot (RP) of HRV signal is obtained and six features are extracted to characterize the basic patterns of the RP. These features consist of length of longest diagonal segments, average length of the diagonal lines, entropy, trapping time, length of longest vertical line, and recurrence trend. In the third step, these features are reduced to three features by the linear discriminant analysis (LDA) technique. Using LDA not only reduces the number of the input features, but also increases the classification accuracy by selecting the most discriminating features. Finally, a support vector machine-based classifier is used to classify the HRV signals. The performance of the proposed method in prediction of PAF episodes was evaluated using the Atrial Fibrillation Prediction Database which consists of both 30-minutes ECG recordings end just prior to the onset of PAF and segments at least 45 min distant from any PAF events. The obtained sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictivity were 96.55%, 100%, and 100%, respectively.},

	Abstract = {Frequency domain analysis of heart rate variability (HRV) is used for the evaluation of autonomic activity. Non-linear domain parameters from HRV are also considered useful. However, properties of the latter have not yet been clearly characterized. Therefore, we studied the relationships among the frequency domain and non-linear parameters from HRV. Continuous Holter electrocardiographic monitoring was conducted on 43 healthy female medical staff including laboratory technologists and nurses during an 8-hour working period in our hospital. Low and high frequency components (LF and HF, respectively) of the frequency domain, recurrence rate (REC%) on recurrence plot analysis, scaling exponents al and a2 on detrended fluctuation analysis, and approximate entropy (ApEn) were obtained from HRV. Both the LF/HF ratio and HF were correlated with al and ApEn. REC% was correlated with ApEn and alpha2, whereas alpha2 was correlated only with REC%. Although autonomic parameters from the frequency domain are closely related with some of the non-linear parameters, it is suggested that a2 and REC% reflect different physiological activities.},

	Abstract = {OBJECTIVE: Testing the hypothesis that alterations in non-linear dynamics of the cardiovascular variability appear in healthy, awake subjects during voluntary apnea.
SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Ten young subjects performed 20 apneas 60 s each separated by 1 min free breathing. Inter-beat interval (IBI) measured as RR-interval in ECG, systolic (SYS) and diastolic (DIAS) arterial blood pressure. stroke volume (SV), cardiac output (CO) and total peripheral resistance (TPR) were non-invasively recorded and computed by Portapress 2 system. Correlation dimension according to Grassberger-Proccacia algorithm (CD) and ratio of % determinism versus % recurrence (RDR) computed from recurrence plot according to Webber and Zbiluth [J. Appl. Physiol. 76 (1994) 965] were used as the indices of chaos and complexity. Sequential time series of cardiovascular variables in consecutive 60-s apneas and inter-apnea free breathings were separately windowed and aggregated. CD and RDR of aggregated apneic time series were compared with CD and RDR values of aggregated time series of inter-apnea free breathing, 10 min at rest and 10 min recovery. Reliability of the aggregation method of sequential time series was tested on transformed simulated data generated by Lorenz model. Error in CD and RDR estimation did not exceed 5% and 1%. respectively.
RESULTS: CD of cardiovascular variables computed from aggregated apneas was significantly reduced and RDR augmented versus control and recovery periods. CD and RDR values of inter-apnea phases were in between those in control and during apneas. Time domain linear variance (SD) was increased during aggregated apneas.
CONCLUSIONS: Signal dynamics dependent windowing and data aggregation could be a useful tool for non-linear analysis of short repeatable sequential time series; time domain linear variability of the cardiovascular dynamics is augmented while complexity reduced during apneic chemoreceptor stimulation; alterations in non-linear dynamics of cardiovascular variables during apneas in healthy normotensive subjects may suggest an early sign of a mechanism implicated in arterial hypertension in OSAS.},

@article{Zbilut2002Recurrence-quan,
	Abstract = {The complexity, nonlinearity and nonstationarity of the cardiovascular system typically defy comprehensive and deterministic mathematical modeling, except from a statistical perspective. Living systems are governed by numerous, continuously changing, interacting variables in the presence of noise. Cardiovascular signals can be shown to be discontinuous alternations between deterministic trajectories and stochastic pauses (terminal dynamics). One promising approach for assessing such nondeterministic complexity is recurrence quantification analysis (RQA). As reviewed in this paper, strategies implementing quantification of recurrences have been successful in diagnosing changes in nonstationary cardiac signals not easily detected by traditional methods. It is concluded that recurrence quantification analysis is a powerful discriminatory tool which, when properly applied to cardiac signals, can provide objectivity regarding the degree of determinism characterizing the system, state changes, as well as degrees of complexity and/or randomness.},

	Abstract = {The boxplot has proven to be a very useful tool for summarizing
            univariate data. Several options of bivariate boxplot-type
            constructions are discussed. These include both elliptic and
            asymmetric plots. An inner region contains 50% of the data, and a
            fence identifies potential outliers. Such a robust plot shows
            location, scale, correlation, and a resistant regression line.
            Alternative constructions are compared in terms of efficiency of
            the relevant parameters. Additional properties are given and
            recommendations made. Emphasis is given to the bivariate biweight
            M estimator. Several practical examples illustrate that standard
            least squares ellipsoids can give graphically misleading
            summaries.},

@article{stock:1991,
	Abstract = {Examined here were the accuracy and bias of estimates of whisker
            length based on box, line, and midgap plots. For each type of
            graph, a different sample of undergraduates viewed 48 single-plot
            graphs. For each plot, subjects were given the length of an
            interquartile spread and asked to estimate the length of a
            whisker. Plots varied in spatial orientation (horizontal or
            vertical), interquartile spread, the ratio of whisker length to
            interquartile spread, and whisker judged. Overall, estimates of
            whisker length for box and line plots were more accurate and less
            biased than those for midgap plots. Interquartile spread, the
            ratio of whisker length to interquartile spread, and the
            interaction of these two factors significantly influenced both
            accuracy and bias. Boxplots displayed a predicted pattern of
            over- and underestimation. We discuss how the present results
            complement related work of others (e.g., Cleveland & McGill,
            1984) on depiction of quantity. We conclude that midgap plots are
            less optimal displays than box and line plots. },

This phenomenon follows from another, maybe more intuitive fact, applied to Y := log(10)X: For many real random variables Y, the remainder U := Y - [Y] is approximately uniformly distributed on [0, 1). The present paper provides new explicit bounds for the latter approximation in terms of the total variation of the density of Y or some derivative of it. These bounds are an interesting and powerful alternative to Fourier methods. As a by-product we obtain explicit bounds for the approximation error in Benford's law.},

This random element is compared with its symmetrized version S-0 := Sigma(i=1)(n) xi(i)phi(i Pi(i)) and its decoupled version (S) over tilde := Sigma(i=1)(n) phi(<(i Pi)over tilde>(i)), where xi = (xi(i))(1 less than or equal to i less than or equal to n) is a Rademacher sequence and <(Pi)over tilde> is uniformly distributed on {1,2,...,n}(n) such that Phi, Pi, <(Pi)over tilde> and xi are independent.

@article{Smith2001Sampling-scheme,
	Abstract = {This article illustrates a technique for visualizing nonlinear mappings f : R-k --> R-m that arise frequently in engineering applications. The idea is based on viewing sections f(-1)(B) of the domain R-k, and f (A) of the range R-m, respectively. After suitable discretization, such sections are easily approximated with familiar brushing operations in scatterplot matrices. An obvious approach to discretization is to evaluate f on a factorial grid in Rk and view the sections by restriction to the grid and its image. The problem is that factorial grids grow large quickly for desirable numbers of grid points (knots) and even moderate dimensions k. The problem can be solved by thinning factorial grids using techniques familiar from experimental design: orthogonal arrays constructed from sets of orthogonal Latin squares. As a result, one obtains manageable sets of domain points with desirable visual properties, high density in each variable pair, and the ability to capture pairwise variable interactions in f. The benefits of this scheme are illustrated using a model of stresses in the manufacture of lamp filaments. The use of experimental designs in the analysis of computer-generated quantitative models is well established in the literature. The main application is for estimating high-dimensional integrals, but Owen (1992) mentioned also the use for visualizing such models. The purpose of this article is to execute in detail one possible approach to model visualization, namely, one based on familiar brushing operations on scatterplot matrices.},

	Abstract = {We discuss the application of interactive visualization techniques to multidimensional scaling (MDS). MDS in its conventional batch implementations is prone to uncertainties with regard to (a) local minima in the underlying optimization, (b) sensitivity to the choice of the optimization criterion, (c) artifacts in point configurations, and (d) local inadequacy of the point configurations.

These uncertainties will be addressed by the following interactive techniques: (a) algorithm animation, random restarts, and manual editing of configurations, (b) interactive control over parameters that determine the criterion and its minimization, (c) diagnostics for pinning down artifactual point configurations, and (d) restricting MDS to subsets of objects and subsets of pairs of objects.

A system, called "XGvis", which implements these techniques, is freely available with the "XGobi" distribution. XGobi is a multivariate data visualization system that is used here for visualizing point configurations.},

@article{Buja2008Data-visualizat,
	Abstract = {We discuss methodology for multidimensional scaling (MDS) and its implementation in two software systems, GGvis and XGvis. MDS is a visualization technique for proximity data, that is, data in the form of N x N dissimilarity matrices. MDS constructs maps ("configurations,""embeddings") in Rk by interpreting the dissimilarities as distances. Two frequent sources of dissimilarities are high-dimensional data and graphs. When the dissimilarities are distances between high-dimensional objects, MDS acts as a (often nonlinear) dimension-reduction technique. When the dissimilarities are shortest-path distances in a graph, MDS acts as a graph layout technique. MDS has found recent attention in machine learning motivated by image databases ("Isomap"). MDS is also of interest in view of the popularity of "kernelizing" approaches inspired by Support Vector Machines (SVMs; "kernel PCA").

This article discusses the following general topics: (1) the stability and multiplicity of MDS solutions; (2) the analysis of structure within and between subsets of objects with missing value schemes in dissimilarity matrices; (3) gradient descent for optimizing general MDS loss functions ("Strain" and "Stress"); (4) a unification of classical (Strain-based) and distance (Stress-based) MDS.

Particular topics include the following: (1) blending of automatic optimization with interactive displacement of configuration points to assist in the search for global optima; (2) forming groups of objects with interactive brushing to create patterned missing values in MDS loss functions; (3) optimizing MDS loss functions for large numbers of objects relative to a small set of anchor points ("external unfolding"); and (4) a non-metric version of classical MDS.

We show applications to the mapping of computer usage data, to the dimension reduction of marketing segmentation data, to the layout of mathematical graphs and social networks, and finally to the spatial reconstruction of molecules.},

@article{Huang2008Functional-prin,
	Abstract = {Two existing approaches to functional principal components analysis (FPCA) are due to Rice and Silverman (1991) and Silverman (1996), both based on maximizing variance but introducing penalization in different ways. In this article we propose an alternative approach to FPCA using penalized rank one approximation to the data matrix. Our contributions are four-fold: (1) by considering invariance under scale transformation of the measurements, the new formulation sheds light on how regularization should be performed for FPCA and suggests an efficient power algorithm for computation; (2) it naturally incorporates spline smoothing of discretized functional data; (3) the connection with smoothing splines also facilitates construction of cross-validation or generalized cross-validation criteria for smoothing parameter selection that allows efficient computation; (4) different smoothing parameters are permitted for different FPCs. The methodology is illustrated with a real data example and a simulation.},

The package includes functions for creating different types of tours, including grand, guided, and little tours, which project multivariate data (p-D) down to 1, 2, 3, or, more generally, d (<= p) dimensions. The projected data can be rendered as densities or histograms, scatterplots, anaglyphs, glyphs, scatterplot matrices, parallel coordinate plots, time series or images, and viewed using an R graphics device, passed to GGobi, or saved to disk. A tour path can be stored for visualisation or replay. With this package it is possible to quickly experiment with different, and new, approaches to tours of data.This paper contains animations that can be viewed using the Adobe Acrobat PDF viewer.},

@article{Rousseeuw1996Regression-free,
	Abstract = {In this paper we present robust estimators for the dispersion of the errors in simple linear regression. Existing scale estimators are based on the residuals from an estimator of the regression itself. Instead, we propose scale estimators that do not depend on any previous estimate of the regression parameters. For this purpose we consider triangles formed by data points, and define their vertical height. Taking the repeated median of all such heights leads to a 50\% breakdown point estimator. A second estimator is obtained from the 0.278-quantile of all triangle heights, and results in a breakdown point of 34.7\%. When we restrict ourselves to the heights of adjacent triangles and take their 0.4-quantile, we obtain a much faster estimator with a 20\% breakdown point. Simulations are carried out to study the computation time and statistical performance of these estimators.},

	Abstract = {We present a robust regression method for situations where there are continuous as well as binary regressors. The latter are often the result of encoding one or more categorical variables. In the first step we downweight leverage points by computing robust distances in the space of the continuous regressors. Then we perform a weighted least absolute values fit as a function of the continuous as well as the binary regressors. Finally, the error scale is estimated robustly. We pay particular attention to the two-way model, in which the proposed estimator is compared with an algorithm that treats the continuous and the categorical variables alternately. An S-PLUS function for the proposed estimator is given, and used to analyze a recent data set from economics.},

@article{Hubert1998The-catline-for,
	Abstract = {Motivated by the notion of regression depth (Rousseeuw and Hubert, 1996) we introduce the catline, a new method For simple linear regression. At any bivariate data set Z(n) = {(x(i), y(i)); i=1,...,n} its regression depth is at least n/3. This lower bound is attained For data lying on a convex or concave curve, whereas for perfectly linear data the catline attains a depth of n. We construct an O(n log n) algorithm for the catline, so it can be computed Fast in practice. The catline is Fisher-consistent at any linear model y=beta x+alpha+e in which the error distribution satisfies med(e\x)=0, which encompasses skewed and/or heteroscedastic errors. The breakdown value of the catline is 1/3, and its influence function is bounded. At the bivariate gaussian distribution its asymptotic relative efficiency compared to the L-1 line is 79.3 \% for the slope, and 88.9 \% for the intercept. The finite-sample relative efficiencies are in close agreement with these values. This combination of properties makes the catline an attractive fitting method. (C) 1998 Academic Press.},

	Abstract = {When faced with high-dimensional data, one often uses principal component analysis (PCA) for dimension reduction. Classical PCA constructs a set of uncorrelated variables, which correspond to eigenvectors of the sample covariance matrix. However, it is well-known that this covariance matrix is strongly affected by anomalous observations. It is therefore necessary to apply robust methods that are resistant to possible outliers.

Li and Chen [J. Am. Stat. Assoc. 80 (1985) 759] proposed a solution based on projection pursuit (PP). The idea is to search for the direction in which the projected observations have the largest robust scale. In subsequent steps, each new direction is constrained to be orthogonal to all previous directions. This method is very well suited for high-dimensional data, even when the number of variables p is higher than the number of observations n. However, the,algorithm of Li and Chen has a high computational cost. In the references [C. Croux, A. Ruiz-Gazen, in COMPSTAT: Proceedings in Computational Statistics 1996, Physica-Verlag, Heidelberg, 1996, pp. 211-217, C. Croux and A. Ruiz-Gazen, High Breakdown Estimators for Principal Components: the Projection-Pursuit Approach Revisited, 2000, submitted for publication.], a computationally much more attractive method is presented, but in high dimensions (large p) it has a numerical accuracy problem and still consumes much computation time.

In this paper, we construct a faster two-step algorithm that is more stable numerically. The new algorithm is illustrated on a data set with four dimensions and on two chemometrical data sets with 1200 and 600 dimensions. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {Deepest regression (DR) is a method for linear regression introduced by P. J. Rousseeuw and M. Hubert (1999, J. Amer. Statis. Assoc. 94, 388-402). The DR method is defined as the fit with largest regression depth relative to the data. In this paper we show that DR is a robust method, with breakdown value that converges almost surely to 1/3 in any dimension. We construct an approximate algorithm for fast computation of DR in more than two dimensions. From the distribution of the regression depth we derive tests for the true unknown parameters in the linear regression model. Moreover, we construct simultaneous confidence regions based on bootstrapped estimates. We also use the maximal regression depth to construct a test for linearity versus convexity/concavity. We extend regression depth and deepest regression to more general models. We apply DR to polynomial regression and show that the deepest polynomial regression has breakdown value 1/3. Finally, DR is applied to the Michaelis-Menten model of enzyme kinetics, where it resolves a long-standing ambiguity. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science (USA).},

@article{Hubert2003A-robust-PCR-me,
	Abstract = {We consider the multivariate calibration model which assumes that the concentrations of several constituents of a sample are linearly related to its spectrum. Principal component regression (PCR) is widely used for the estimation of the regression parameters in this model. In the classical approach it combines principal component analysis (PCA) on the regressors with least squares regression. However, both stages yield very unreliable results when the data set contains outlying observations. We present a robust PCR (RPCR) method which also consists of two parts. First we apply a robust PCA method for high-dimensional data on the regressors, then we regress the response variables on the scores using a robust regression method. A robust RMSECV value and a robust R-2 value are proposed as exploratory tools to select the number of principal components. The prediction error is also estimated in a robust way. Moreover, we introduce several diagnostic plots which are helpful to visualize and classify the outliers. The robustness of RPCR is demonstrated through simulations and the analysis of a real data set. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

	Abstract = {Partial least squares regression (PLSR) is a linear regression technique developed to deal with high-dimensional regressors and one or several response variables. In this paper we introduce robustified versions of the SIMPLS algorithm, this being the leading PLSR algorithm because of its speed and efficiency. Because SIMPLS is based on the empirical cross-covariance matrix between the response variables and the regressors and on linear least squares regression, the results are affected by abnormal observations in the data set. Two robust methods, RSIMCD and RSIMPLS, are constructed from a robust covariance matrix for high-dimensional data and robust linear regression. We introduce robust RMSECV and RMSEP values for model calibration and model validation. Diagnostic plots are constructed to visualize and classify the outliers. Several simulation results and the analysis of real data sets show the effectiveness and robustness of the new approaches. Because RSIMPLS is roughly twice as fast as RSIMCD, it stands out as the overall best method. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Engelen2005Fast-model-sele,
	Abstract = {One of the main issues in principal component regression (PCR) and partial least squares regression (PLSR) is the selection of the number of principal components. To this end, the curve with the root mean squared error of cross-validated prediction (RMSECV) is often described in the literature as a very helpful graphical tool. In this paper, we focus on model selection for robust calibration methods. We first propose a robust RMSECV value and then use it to define a new criterion for the selecting of the optimal number of components. This robust component selection (RCS) statistic combines the goodness-of-fit and the predictive power of the model. As the algorithms to compute these robust PCR and PLSR estimators are more complex and slower than the classical approaches, cross-validation becomes very time consuming. Hence, we propose fast algorithms to compute the robust RMSECV values. We evaluate the developed procedures at several data sets. (c) 2005 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

	Abstract = {The kurtosis coefficient is often regarded as a measure of the tail heaviness of a distribution relative to that of the normal distribution. However, it also measures the peakedness of a distribution, hence there is no agreement on what kurtosis really estimates. Another disadvantage of the kurtosis is that its interpretation and consequently its use is restricted to symmetric distributions. Moreover, the kurtosis coefficient is very sensitive to outliers in the data. To overcome these problems, several measures of left and right tail weight for univariate continuous distributions are proposed. They can be applied to symmetric as well as asymmetric distributions that do not need to have finite moments. Their interpretation is clear and they are robust against outlying values. The breakdown value and the influence functions of these measures and the resulting asymptotic variances are discussed and used to construct goodness-of-fit tests. Simulated as well as real data are employed for further comparison of the proposed measures. (c) 2004 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Debruyne2008Censored-depth-,
	Abstract = {Quantile regression is a wide spread regression technique which allows to model the entire conditional distribution of the response variable. A natural extension to the case of censored observations has been introduced using a reweighting scheme based on the Kaplan-Meier estimator. The same ideas can be applied to depth quantiles. This leads to regression quantiles for censored data which are robust to both outliers in the predictor and the response variable. For their computation, a fast algorithm over a grid of quantile values is proposed. The robustness of the method is shown in a simulation study and on two real data examples. (C) 2007 Elsevier B.V.

@article{Hubert2008Outlier-detecti,
	Abstract = {Most outlier detection rules for multivariate data are based on the assumption of elliptical symmetry of the underlying distribution. We propose an outlier detection method which does not need the assumption of symmetry and does not rely on visual inspection. Our method is a generalization of the Stahel-Donoho outlyingness. The latter approach assigns to each observation a measure of outlyingness, which is obtained by projection pursuit techniques that only use univariate robust measures of location and scale. To allow skewness in the data, we adjust this measure of outlyingness by using a robust measure of skewness as well. The observations corresponding to an outlying value of the adjusted outlyingness (AO) are then considered as outliers. For bivariate data, our approach leads to two graphical representations. The first one is a contour plot of the AO values. We also construct an extension of the boxplot for bivariate data, in the spirit of the bagplot [1] which is based on the concept of half space depth. We illustrate our outlier detection method on several simulated and real data. Copyright (c) 2008 John Wiley \& Sons, Ltd.},

@article{Hubert2008High-breakdown-,
	Abstract = {When applying a statistical method in practice it often occurs that some observations deviate from the usual assumptions. However, many classical methods are sensitive to outliers. The goal of robust statistics is to develop methods that are robust against the possibility that one or several unannounced outliers may occur anywhere in the data. These methods then allow to detect outlying observations by their residuals from a robust fit. We focus on high-breakdown methods, which can deal with a substantial fraction of outliers in the data. We give an overview of recent high-breakdown robust methods for multivariate settings such as covariance estimation, multiple and multivariate regression, discriminant analysis, principal components and multivariate calibration.},

It shows information about the location, spread, skewness as well as the tails of the data. However. when the data are skewed, usually many points exceed the whiskers and are often erroneously declared as outliers. An adjustment of the boxplot is presented that includes a robust measure of skewness in the determination of the whiskers. This results in a more accurate representation of the data and of possible outliers. Consequently, this adjusted boxplot can also be used as a fast and automatic outlier detection tool without making any parametric assumption about the distribution of the bulk of the data. Several examples and simulation results show the advantages of this new procedure. (c) 2007 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{Debruyne2008Model-Selection,
	Abstract = {Recent results about the robustness of kernel methods involve the analysis of influence functions. By definition the influence function is closely related to leave-one-out criteria. In statistical learning, the latter is often used to assess the generalization of a method. In statistics, the influence function is used in a similar way to analyze the statistical efficiency of a method. Links between both worlds are explored. The influence function is related to the first term of a Taylor expansion. Higher order influence functions are calculated. A recursive relation between these terms is found characterizing the full Taylor expansion. It is shown how to evaluate influence functions at a specific sample distribution to obtain an approximation of the leave-one-out error. A specific implementation is proposed using a L-1 loss in the selection of the hyperparameters and a Huber loss in the estimation procedure. The parameter in the Huber loss controlling the degree of robustness is optimized as well. The resulting procedure gives good results, even when outliers are present in the data.},

	Abstract = {Kernel Principal Component Analysis extends linear PCA from a Euclidean space to any reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Robustness issues for Kernel PCA are studied. The sensitivity of Kernel PCA to individual observations is characterized by calculating the influence function. A robust Kernel PCA method is proposed by incorporating kernels in the Spherical PCA algorithm. Using the scores from Spherical Kernel PCA, a graphical diagnostic is proposed to detect points that are influential for ordinary Kernel PCA. (C) 2009 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.},

@article{tukey1991manycovar,
	Abstract = {Clinical trials are almost always limited in number of patients, and when end points are qualitative, even more limited in the number of the rarer end point (often death). Yet we often feel we should make use of many covariates, more than should be used in any single regression. Composites formed by weighting the potential covariates are a natural choice. Weights based on the degree of significance of individual separate regressions involving compartments-combined data seem theoretically plausible and proved practically effective in the Anturane Reinfarction Trial. (It often pays to tailor the complexity of fitting to the extent of data available. In some circumstances, fitting an imprecise composite can help while fitting all its components separately loses.) In more complicated and data-richer situations, like the National Halothane Study, a smear-and-sweep procedure blending one classification after another into a composite classification may be helpful. /// Dans les essais th{\'e}rapeutiques, le nombre des sujets exp{\'e}rimentaux est presque toujours tr{\`e}s limit{\'e}. Lorsque les {\'e}v{\'e}nements d{\'e}cisifs sont de nature qualitative, le nombre des {\'e}v{\'e}nements rares (souvent la mort) est encore beaucoup plus faible. Pourtant souvent il semble n{\'e}cessaire d'utiliser plusieurs covariables, plus qu'il n'en faudrait dans n'importe quelle r{\'e}gression isol{\'e}e. Un choix naturel serait de former des variables composites en pond{\'e}rant des covariables potentielles. Il semble th{\'e}oriquement plausible et il s'av{\`e}re pratiquement efficace, dans l'essai de l'Anturane contre l'infarctus r{\'e}cidivant, d'utiliser des poids bas{\'e}s sur le niveau de signification des r{\'e}gressions individuelles s{\'e}par{\'e}es. (Il est souvent utile d'adapter la complexit{\'e} de l'adjustement {\`a} la plus ou moins grande masse des donn{\'e}es disponsibles. Dans certaines circonstances, l'ajustement d'une variable composite impr{\'e}cise est pr{\'e}f{\'e}rable {\`a} l'ajustement s{\'e}par{\'e} de ses composantes.) Dans des cas plus compliqu{\'e}s et plus riches en donn{\'e}es, comme l'Etude Nationale sur le Halothane, une proc{\'e}dure d'{\'e}talement-et-compression combinant des classifications successives en une classification composite peut {\^e}tre utile.},

                  demonstrates the different methods available and in
                  which situations each one applies. It covers all of
                  the standard topics, from the basics of estimation to
                  missing data, factorial designs, and block designs,
                  but it also includes discussion of topics, such as
                  model uncertainty, rarely addressed in books of this
                  type. The presentation incorporates an abundance of
                  examples that clarify both the use of each technique
                  and the conclusions one can draw from the results.},
